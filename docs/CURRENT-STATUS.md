# Armaghan — Current Status

Last reconciled: 2026-10-02
Canonical main head at reconciliation start: `8ed3f26bd4841feae3a020f2df263d28fe720f15`

This file is the **current operational source of truth** for the next run. Historical decision records remain useful, but when an older document conflicts with this file, use this file plus the latest `docs/HANDOFF.md` and `docs/BACKLOG.md`.

## Executive status

Core MVP delivery is approximately **87–90% complete**. Core admin CRUD, public catalog reads, guarded schema/dependency deployment and production product-media ownership/upload are live. The remaining work is customer API/session flows, persisted favorites/Magic Link behavior, off-host backup/restore hardening, and final end-to-end acceptance.

Current UI lane:
- Test 26: frozen/immutable.
- Test 27: active mutable review lane and visible in the test launcher.
- Test 27 is live under `/t/27`.
- Customer visual-correction batch is live in Test 27: logo-only footer branding, six-way product labels/unified unavailable state, hidden-by-default subcategory codes, white Products background, Mint cards, strong green heading role, Brand Blue/Gold Why styling. FTP Deploy #277 delivered the customer correction set; final heading-green polish FTP Deploy #282 PASS. No remote deletion occurred and root deployment remained skipped.

Current backend lane:
- Laravel 13.34.0 is live under `/backend`.
- Production SQLite is active and is the primary database.
- Production Style Profile persistence/version/restore semantics are verified against the live SQLite database.
- One real active production administrator exists.
- Filament login page is live.
- Category/Subcategory/Product/Customer Filament Resources are implemented and live in production. Taxonomy commit `4281034656...` passed Backend CI #31; Product/Customer commit `de450a15...` passed Backend CI #33; Backend Code Deploy #3 passed with all four Resource routes returning HTTP 200.
- A guarded code-only Backend update lane is operational: it refuses Composer/migration drift, creates a pre-swap SQLite snapshot, stages private/public code, HTTP-smokes the release and rolls code back on failure. Run #1 deliberately rolled back after a public-permission smoke failure; Runs #2–#5 passed.
- Public catalog API is live at `/backend/api/catalog/categories` and `/backend/api/catalog/products`; production catalog is initialized with **3 categories / 6 subcategories / 18 products**.
- Test 27 performs non-blocking Hybrid Sync: Backend-managed names/status/active state overlay the browser catalog. Server product media now overrides the local gallery when present; local media/specs remain fallback while a server gallery is empty or the API is unavailable.
- Production product media is live through Spatie Media Library + the official Filament integration: ordered `product-gallery`, JPEG/PNG/WebP validation, 8 MiB and 5000×5000 limits, metadata-stripping re-encode, non-cropping/non-upscaling card/thumb conversions, and public delivery through `/backend/storage`.
- The production `media` table is migrated and the public-storage symlink is verified. The current 18 bootstrapped products still have zero server media rows until an authenticated administrator uploads real product images; Test 27 therefore continues to show the existing local fallback images without regression.
- A guarded additive Backend deploy lane is production-proven for create-only migrations/dependency changes. Backend Additive Deploy #3 created a consistent SQLite snapshot, applied exactly one additive media migration, verified the public storage link, passed all HTTP smokes, and cleaned temporary files.
- Final browser-authenticated Test 27 Style Profile acceptance is still open but is non-blocking. A read-only check of the saved browser profile redirected to `/backend/admin/login`, so delivery does not rely on that session.

## Production backend — verified complete

The current production backend is no longer a planning-only or local-only implementation.

Verified:
- PHP 8.3.33 on LiteSpeed.
- PDO SQLite: PASS.
- SQLite3 extension: PASS.
- SQLite 3.53.4.
- Private SQLite file create/read/write: PASS.
- SQLite foreign keys: PASS.
- SQLite `VACUUM INTO`: PASS.
- Private application/data sibling outside `public_html`: PASS.
- HTTPS execution: PASS.
- Laravel 13.34.0 deployed under `/backend`.
- Host-only `.env` and APP_KEY remain outside Git and logs.
- Production SQLite database created outside `public_html`.
- Production migrations: PASS.
- Initial consistent SQLite snapshot: PASS.
- Core schema checks: users, products, customers, Style Profile tables, media table.
- Production image runtime requirements: GD + EXIF accepted by the guarded Media deployment preflight.
- Public product media link: `/backend/storage` active.
- Public backend smoke:
  - `/backend/` → 200
  - `/backend/up` → 200
  - `/backend/api/style-profile/staging` → 200
  - `/backend/admin/login` → 200
  - `/backend/api/catalog/categories` → 200
  - `/backend/api/catalog/products?per_page=1` → 200
- Public Laravel permissions normalized to LiteSpeed-safe directories `0755` / files `0644`; private data permissions were not widened.

## First production administrator — verified complete

A real production active-admin account exists.

- Account identity: `admin@armaghan.local`.
- No fixed/default password is committed or documented.
- Plaintext credential is not stored in the repository.
- Provisioning/recovery flow is fail-closed and tested.
- Active-admin policy and password hashing verification passed.
- Filament login route smoke passed.

Do not create another bootstrap admin unless the existing account is intentionally rotated/removed through an explicit administration decision.

## Test 27 visual editor — live state

Current Test 27 editor capabilities:
- Admin-only visual editor launcher.
- Mobile non-modal resizable bottom sheet.
- Direct touch selection.
- Explicit chooser for nearby/nested targets.
- Structured element browser.
- Recoverable hidden targets.
- Text editing for registered locale-aware targets.
- Approved-token text/background/border controls.
- Hide/show and per-target reset.
- Contrast guard for explicit text/background token pairs.
- Browser-local autosave.
- Sanitized JSON export/import for manual portability only.
- Laravel Style Profile adapter.
- Sync status: local / checking / saving / synced / conflict / error.
- 900ms debounced authenticated server draft save.
- `expected_checksum` optimistic-concurrency protection.
- Explicit HTTP 409 conflict resolution.
- Staging Publish.
- Recent immutable version history.
- Restore-as-new-version behavior.

### Current Test 27 customer color state

Canonical approved palette:
- Brand Green: `#21946A`
- Brand Blue / logo-background blue: `#0714C2`
- Brand Mint: `#C8E3DB`
- Brand White: `#FFFFFF`
- Brand Gold: `#FFB514`

The old canonical blue `#151EDA` is retired for Test 27.

Current semantic defaults:
- Header/Footer/Hero brand chrome → Brand Blue `#0714C2`.
- Home light-mode page background → Brand White.
- Primary Home panel background → Brand Mint.
- `home.page` background is editable but the root itself cannot be hidden.
- `home.content` is separately hideable/selectable.

Test 27 color/saveability implementation is live; FTP Deploy Run #268 passed with no remote deletes and no root deployment.

## Style Profile production persistence — verified server-side

Production Style Profile persistence has passed a live transactional acceptance test against the real production SQLite database.

Production acceptance Run `36878931948`: **PASS**.

Verified inside one outer transaction:
- draft save;
- first staging Publish;
- second changed staging Publish;
- Restore from the first version as a new immutable version;
- staging publication pointer update;
- ActivityLog writes.

Observed during the transaction:
- 3 new immutable versions;
- 3 new activity records.

The outer transaction was rolled back. Post-test logical state exactly matched pre-test state. Temporary public helper cleanup passed.

### Only remaining editor persistence acceptance

The server-side semantics are no longer uncertain.

The remaining acceptance is **browser-only**:
1. authenticate through the real Filament login at `/backend/admin/login`;
2. open Test 27 as the authenticated administrator;
3. edit a registered target;
4. confirm the editor reaches server-synced state;
5. reload and confirm the draft persists;
6. verify the shared draft from another browser/device session;
7. Publish staging through the UI;
8. Restore an older version through the UI;
9. confirm CSRF/session behavior stays valid throughout.

Do not weaken authentication or add a bypass just to automate this final browser step.

## Backend domain state

Implemented models/foundation:
- User
- Category
- Subcategory
- Product
- ProductSpecValue
- SpecDefinition
- Customer
- FavoriteShare
- MagicLink
- ActivityLog
- StyleProfile
- StyleProfileVersion
- StyleProfilePublication

Implemented production-facing controllers:
- Public Style Profile read controller.
- Admin Style Profile controller.
- Public Catalog controller + API Resources for Category/Product reads.

Production catalog state:
- 3 active categories.
- 6 active subcategories.
- 18 active products initialized from the canonical MVP fixture.
- Public catalog filtering/search/pagination and managed-code metadata are live.

Not yet implemented:
- Customer public/admin API controllers needed by customer self-service/session flows.
- Full FavoriteShare HTTP flow.
- Full MagicLink HTTP/session flow.

Product media ownership/upload is implemented and live. The public catalog now returns a `media` array per Product and Test 27 prefers that server gallery when non-empty. Because the current production Products do not yet have uploaded server media, local media/specs remain the visible fallback. Customer/account flows still contain prototype/local browser paths until their APIs and Magic Link session flow are implemented.

## Persistence policy

Current policy:
- SQLite is the primary Laravel database for local/dev/test/production.
- JSON is ordinary import/export/fixture interchange only.
- MySQL/MariaDB is optional later as a logical mirror/export/disaster-recovery target.
- Never dual-write normal live requests to SQLite + MySQL.
- Primary backups remain SQLite-to-SQLite consistent snapshots.
- At least one rotated off-host backup + restore drill is still required before final production handoff.

## Remaining core delivery — estimated 3 aggressive / 4 conservative runs + opportunistic browser acceptance

This estimate excludes open-ended new customer UI revisions. The conservative plan keeps Customer/Magic Link and Favorites/WhatsApp as separate bounded runs; the aggressive 3-run path combines them only if the first vertical batch stays within the safety/time budget. Browser-authenticated Style Profile acceptance remains an opportunistic parallel check rather than a blocker because server-side persistence is already production-verified.

1. **Customer API/session + Magic Link core**
   - minimum customer reads/writes required by self-service;
   - safe one-tap customer session, expiry/revoke and audit;
   - remove browser-only customer identity dependencies from the MVP path.

2. **Favorites/WhatsApp persisted share flow**
   - persisted favorite-share links;
   - guest/customer ownership and expiry/revoke;
   - WhatsApp handoff against server-backed shares.

3. **Production hardening**
   - rotated off-host SQLite backup;
   - restore drill;
   - logs/health verification;
   - additive and code-only deploy lanes are already production-proven.

4. **Final end-to-end QA + handoff**
   - mobile/tablet/desktop;
   - RTL/LTR;
   - light/dark;
   - admin/customer permissions;
   - backup/restore;
   - deployment smoke;
   - final customer changes and documentation.


## Highest-priority open items

P0:
1. Implement the minimum customer API/session surface and Magic Link core without modifying frozen Test 26.
2. Implement persisted FavoriteShare/WhatsApp handoff.
3. Configure rotated off-host SQLite backup and perform a restore drill.
4. Complete browser-authenticated Test 27 Style Profile + one real Filament product-image upload acceptance opportunistically when a valid real admin session is available.
5. Keep both Backend deployment lanes green: code-only for ordinary changes, guarded additive for approved create-only migration/dependency changes.

P1:
- Favorites/WhatsApp persisted share flow.
- Customer Magic Link session flow.

P2 / optional:
- MySQL logical mirror/export with verification.
- Supabase only if a concrete managed-Postgres/Auth/Storage/Realtime need appears.
- Advanced analytics/orders/queues unless required for delivery.

## Rules for the next run

1. Read this file first, then `docs/HANDOFF.md`, `docs/BACKLOG.md`, `docs/PROJECT-RULES.md`, and the shared lock.
2. Do not repeat production SQLite activation; it is complete.
3. Do not repeat first-admin bootstrap; one active admin already exists.
4. Do not claim Style Profile server persistence is pending; its production service semantics are verified.
5. The remaining Style Profile task is browser/session/CSRF acceptance.
6. Keep Test 26 immutable.
7. Keep Test 27 as the active mutable UI lane.
8. Never store production plaintext credentials in Git, docs, logs or artifacts.
9. Do not rebuild product-media ownership; it is live. The next P0 is customer API/session + Magic Link core.
10. Do not claim the 18 current Products have server media yet: their API `media` arrays are currently empty and Test 27 intentionally falls back to local media until an admin uploads images.
11. Use the guarded additive lane for future approved create-only migration/dependency changes; ordinary Backend changes stay on the code-only lane.
